## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
data(cars)

plot(cars, col="red")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# load package and data
library(ggplot2)
library(ggExtra)
data(mpg, package="ggplot2")
# mpg <- read.csv("http://goo.gl/uEeRGu")

# Scatterplot
theme_set(theme_bw())  # pre-set the bw theme.
mpg_select <- mpg[mpg$hwy >= 35 & mpg$cty > 27, ]
g <- ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + 
  geom_count() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=F)

ggMarginal(g, type = "histogram", fill="transparent")
ggMarginal(g, type = "boxplot", fill="transparent")
ggMarginal(g, type = "density", fill="transparent")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
